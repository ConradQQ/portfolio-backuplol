       Believe it or not, I actually got my degree in Anthropology in the hopes of becoming a publishing research Archaeologist. However, life took a different turn and I discovered that I wasn&apos;t very interested in being an Archaeologist at all. But it was worth it, along the way I met my best bud and now wife Trina, and have since had our son Milo (and also got to do loads of cool archaeology-related stuff). Life is great.

       Turns out, what I truly wanted to be was a software engineer and general tech nerd. I&apos;ve always loved messing around on my computer, experimenting with all sorts of software, scripting languages, and operating systems. So it only makes sense that I would want to do what I love for a living. So here I am today!
